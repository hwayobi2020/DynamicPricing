Store Environment Simulation with Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
This repository contains a Python project that simulates a store environment using parameters for different business types (restaurant, gym, hospital, coffee shop) and customer behaviors. The simulation integrates elements like floating population dynamics, attention ratios, and peak business hours, which are critical for realistic business operations modeling.

Overview
The simulation utilizes a custom StoreEnv class, defined elsewhere, which sets up an environment with specified parameters for the region and the store. This allows for dynamic adjustments based on external factors like holidays and social media influence.

Key Features
Configurable Store Environment:

Define business attributes such as type, location, operation hours, and cost structure.
Adjust product-specific parameters like pricing and inventory levels.
Deep Q-Network (DQN) Implementation:

Implement a neural network using TensorFlow to learn optimal pricing strategies over time.
Use reinforcement learning techniques with exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize revenue.
Simulation and Visualization:

Run simulations for defined periods using either random actions or trained models.
Visualize the results to analyze the performance and decision-making process of the model.
